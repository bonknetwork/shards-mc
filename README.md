# Shards Datapack
Originally designed for the Shard SMP, a private SMP for friends that was not recorded in any way nor was it public. 
~~Currently discontinued but could be revived for bonk network (https://discord.gg/bonknetwork)~~ Revived, planned use in https://discord.gg/bonknetwork. For those who say this is a Bliss SMP copy, I made this project back in 2020 and used it on the SMP mentioned earlier until 2021. The pack was publicly released in May of 2022 on Planet Minecraft here: https://www.planetminecraft.com/data-pack/shards-data-pack/. Please note I am not in any way implying that they copied me.

# Gameplay Info
There is no system currently to assign new players shards. The only way to obtain shards is through commands. The pack is designed for SMPS where people can obtain all the shards by killing other players. The goal is to throw them on the ground together to craft the shard of RAGE, a shard with almost no debuffs and is insanely overpowered. The current effects are not final and will be changed soon. More in-depth info, although outdated, can be found on the Plant Minecraft page listed above. Simple project plans that are more updated can be found in [project_plan.md](https://github.com/bonknetwork/shards-mc/blob/main/project_plan.md)
