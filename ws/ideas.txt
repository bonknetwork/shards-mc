-(R, IMPLEMENTED) When held in a shard is held in off-hand, shard can give effects.

-(E, CANCELED) Can upgrade shards into remodeled diamond sword

-(E, CANCELED) After killing a player and getting their shard, you can throw your shard, and their shard on the ground with an fragment infuser
to combine the two shards.

	- CANCELED, DEEMED IMPOSSIBLE

	- Should utulize tags, custom model data will make this very hard due to possibly thousands of possibilities.

	- Cannot combine three shards at once.

	- Fragment infuser:
        - Can be crafted like this: Key: i = Iron Ingot, r = Redstone dust, d = Diamond, n = Netherite Ingot, 
        I = Iron Block, R = Redstone Block
