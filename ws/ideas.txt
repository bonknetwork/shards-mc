-(R, In Progress) When held in a shard is held in off-hand, shard can give effects.
	- Cannot also work in main hand because with strength effect, the shard will be too OP.
This is because there is no attack cooldown when hitting with non-tool/weapon items.

	-Shard of Light: Speed 2
	-Shard of War: Strength 1, speed 1

(R, In Progress) When all shards thrown on ground it crafts the shard of RAGE.

-(E) Could make shards carrots/warped fungus on a stick to add right click abillity. Would work very well with idea 2.

-(E, CANCELED) After killing a player and getting their shard, you can throw your shard, and their shard on the ground with an fragment infuser
to combine the two shards.
	- Should utulize tags, custom model data will make this very hard due to possibly thousands of possibilities.

	- Cannot combine three shards at once.

	- Fragment infuser:
        - Can be crafted like this: Key: i = Iron Ingot, r = Redstone dust, d = Diamond, n = Netherite Ingot, 
        I = Iron Block, R = Redstone Block
